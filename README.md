# fit-to-artboard
XD Plugin that resize shapes to fit the artboard in no time, using a custom keyboard shortcut

## How does it work?

The plugin brings 2 useful keyboard shortcuts to Adobe XD:

**Cmd+Shift+n :** Resize the selected object to fit the artboard's **width**.

**Cmd+Shift+j :** Resize the selected object to fit the artboard's **height**.


### Important notes :
- if your object is within a group, you have to select the object, not the parent group.
- works with rectangles and polygons only for now.
